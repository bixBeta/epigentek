Raw fastq files were first quality trimmed using TrimGalore to trim for low quality reads and noisy short (<10bp) fragments and adapter contaminated sequences. 

The trimmed reads were then aligned to the hg38 reference genome using bwa-mem aligner.

All non primary alignments were removed from the sam files using samtools and written in BAM format. 

BAM were then sorted and marked for read duplication using picard tools. 

All duplicated marked sequences were then removed from the BAM files and the filtered bam files were then used for the downstream analysis. 

Chip-peaks (--qvalue 0.05) were called on filtered bam files using macs2 peak caller against the input-control sample.

Peak calls were annotated using ChIPseeker Bioconductor package and HOMER perl suite of tools. 

Bedgraphs were created using makeUCSCfile using `-o auto -fsize 1e10 -res 1 -color 106,42,73 -style chipseq` parameters.
